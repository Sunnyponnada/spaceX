Futuristic Prediction
SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
This repository contains the code for a capstone project predicting the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage.

Project Overview
SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusability is a significant factor in its cost-effectiveness compared to other launch providers. Predicting landing success can inform launch cost estimations for competing companies.

This project tackles the prediction problem in three stages:

Data Collection: This stage retrieves data from SpaceX's API and performs basic cleaning.
Data Wrangling: This stage utilizes web scraping to collect historical launch records from Wikipedia and transforms the data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This stage analyzes the collected data to identify patterns and define labels for training machine learning models.
